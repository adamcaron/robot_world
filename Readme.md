# Robot World:

Create your own Sinatra app from scratch. This app should be a directory of robots. A robot has
 - a name,
 - city,
 - state,
 - avatar, (Use http://robohash.org/ for pictures)
 - birthdate,
 - date hired,
 - and department.

Program the CRUD functionality for robots so that we can
 - see all robots,
 - see one specific robot,
 - edit/update a robot,
 - create a robot,
 - and delete a robot.

Add a dashboard that shows statistical data:
 - average robot age,
 - a breakdown of how many robots were hired each year,
 - and number of robots in each
 -  - department
 - - city
 - - state

## Extensions:

Can you use HAML for your html templates instead of ERB?
Can you use a partial in your views?
Can you use the Pony gem to send an email from your Sinatra app?
Can you protect your app using HTTP Basic Auth?
